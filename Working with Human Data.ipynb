    "According to http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/BK2Format.html, “.bk2 is an archive file that contains movie data broken into various files. It is a zip format and can be opened with any unzip tool, such as 7z.” Essentially, bk2 files allow us to record and play previous input back. Most bk2 files on the internet are stored in the TASVideos website and these movies are usually tool-assisted speedrun. For example, http://tasvideos.org/2948M.html is the speedrun movie for ActRaiser 2 in SNES. To get a better description of what a bk2 file is, check out http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/BK2Format.html\n",

    "Unfortunately, there are several issues preventing us from using almost all of the movie files in TASVideo. First of all, not all movies in TASVideo are in the bk2 format. Some of them are bkm files, the obsolete movie format, while some others are lsmv files or smv files, movie formats for other emulators. Although bizhawk provides a way to convert them to bk2 format, it is not guaranteed that the converted bk2 files would still be in sync. Even with a bk2 files there is still a chance where it is not compatible with the latest version of BizHawk because it is recorded in a much older version of BizHawk."
